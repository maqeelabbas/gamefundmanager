# Token Refresh Implementation Complete

## Summary of Changes

### Backend Implementation
1. **Added Token Refresh Endpoint**
   - Created `/auth/refresh-token` endpoint in `AuthController.cs`
   - Implemented token validation without lifetime checks
   - Implemented token refresh functionality that generates new tokens

2. **Created DTOs for Token Refresh**
   - Added `RefreshTokenDto` for request data
   - Added `RefreshTokenResponseDto` for response data

3. **Updated Auth Service**
   - Added `ValidateTokenWithoutLifetimeChecks` method
   - Added `RefreshTokenAsync` method to generate new tokens
   - Made both methods handle error cases gracefully

### Frontend Implementation
1. **Updated Token Service**
   - Improved error handling for refresh token requests
   - Added proper response parsing for the new backend endpoint
   - Added 401 detection to handle invalid tokens appropriately

2. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation of the token refresh mechanism

## Testing
1. **Backend Tests**
   - Successful build with only minor warnings
   - API endpoints function as expected

2. **Frontend Tests**
   - Metro server starts successfully
   - Token refresh mechanism works correctly
   - No more infinite token refresh loops

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding refresh token storage for better security
2. Implement token blacklisting for revoked tokens
3. Add monitoring for token refresh patterns

## Conclusion
The 401 Unauthorized errors have been fixed by implementing a proper token refresh mechanism. The solution is robust, handling edge cases such as network errors, invalid tokens, and prevents infinite refresh loops.
