# Group Member Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the group member management functionality in the GameFund Manager application. This feature allows group administrators to add existing users to groups, manage member roles, and control member contribution settings.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Model Structure
- Extended `GroupMember` entity with contribution management properties:
  - `JoinedDate`: Tracks when the member joined the group
  - `ContributionStartDate`: When the member should start contributing
  - `IsContributionPaused`: Flag indicating if contributions are paused
  - `ContributionPauseStartDate`: When the contribution pause begins
  - `ContributionPauseEndDate`: When the contribution pause ends

### 2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Created `AddGroupMemberDto` for adding new members to groups
- Created `PauseMemberContributionDto` for pausing member contributions
- Created `UserSearchResponseDto` for user search results

### 3. Service and Repository Interfaces
- Added `SearchUsersAsync` method to `IUserService` and `IUserRepository`
- Enhanced `IGroupService` with member management methods:
  - `AddMemberToGroupAsync`
  - `UpdateMemberRoleAsync`
  - `PauseMemberContributionAsync`
  - `ResumeMemberContributionAsync`

### 4. API Controllers
- Added search endpoint to `UsersController` for searching users
- Enhanced `GroupsController` with member management endpoints:
  - `GET` `/groups/{groupId}/members` to get group members
  - `POST` `/groups/{groupId}/members` to add a member
  - `DELETE` `/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}` to remove a member
  - `PATCH` `/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}/role` to update role
  - `POST` `/groups/{groupId}/members/pause-contribution` to pause contributions
  - `POST` `/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}/resume-contribution` to resume contributions

### 5. Service Implementations
- Implemented `SearchUsersAsync` in `UserService`
- Implemented member management methods in `GroupService`
- Added proper authorization checks for member management operations
- Created database migration for new entity properties

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. API Services
- Enhanced `userService` with `searchUsers` method
- Enhanced `groupService` with member management functions:
  - `addGroupMember`
  - `updateMemberRole`
  - `pauseMemberContribution`
  - `resumeMemberContribution`
  - `removeGroupMember`

### 2. Models
- Updated `GroupMember` interface to include contribution management properties
- Created `AddGroupMemberRequest` interface
- Created `PauseMemberContributionRequest` interface

### 3. UI Components
- Created `AddGroupMemberScreen` component for adding members
- Updated `MembersTab` component in group details screen
- Enhanced `MemberList` component with member management actions
- Using existing `PauseContributionModal` component for selecting pause dates

### 4. Navigation
- Added `AddGroupMember` route to navigation types and Root Navigator

## Security Considerations
- All member management endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access control ensures only group admins can perform management actions
- Validation is performed on both client and server sides

## Future Improvements
- Implement invitation system for new users not yet in the system
- Add bulk member management actions
- Implement more advanced contribution scheduling options
- Add notifications for members when their status changes

## Testing Notes
- Verify all member management operations work as expected
- Test with different user roles to ensure proper authorization
- Verify UI updates immediately after member status changes
- Test with poor network conditions to ensure proper error handling
