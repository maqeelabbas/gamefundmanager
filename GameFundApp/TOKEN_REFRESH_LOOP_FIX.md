# Token Refresh Loop Fix

## Problem
The app was getting stuck in an infinite token refresh loop due to:
1. Missing token expiry information
2. Always treating tokens without expiry information as expired
3. Continuous attempts to refresh tokens with backend endpoint that may not exist yet
4. No throttling or safety mechanisms to prevent infinite loops

## Solution
Several fixes have been implemented to address these issues:

### In token.service.ts:

1. **Default Expiry for Existing Tokens**
   - When a token exists but has no expiry info, a default expiry of 24 hours is set
   - This prevents continuous refresh attempts for tokens that are likely valid

2. **Refresh Rate Limiting**
   - Added a counter to limit token refresh attempts
   - After multiple unsuccessful attempts, the service waits before trying again
   - Temporary default expiry is set when refresh fails

3. **Refresh Locking Mechanism**
   - Prevents concurrent refresh operations with an AsyncStorage lock
   - Automatically clears lock after 5 seconds to prevent deadlocks

4. **Graceful Fallback**
   - When refresh endpoint isn't available, system continues using existing token
   - Sets a reasonable temporary expiry to prevent continuous refresh attempts

### In api.service.ts:

1. **API Call Throttling**
   - Added a counter to detect and prevent API call storms
   - Resets counter periodically to allow normal operation
   - Throws helpful error message when possible infinite loop detected

2. **Smarter Auth Endpoint Detection**
   - Improved logic to better identify authentication endpoints
   - Added healthcheck endpoint to the exclusion list

### In UserDetailsScreen.tsx:

1. **Enhanced Retry Logic**
   - Added additional safety check to prevent excessive retries
   - Improved logging for better debugging
   - User-friendly error message when retries are exhausted

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:
1. The app should successfully load without getting stuck in refresh loops
2. Token validation should happen smoothly in the background
3. Default expiry information should be created for existing tokens

## Notes for Future Development
1. The backend should implement a proper token refresh endpoint at `/auth/refresh-token`
2. Consider adding more user feedback during auth operations
3. Implement a more sophisticated token storage mechanism with encryption
