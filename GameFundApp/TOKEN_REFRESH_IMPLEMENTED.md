# Token Refresh Implementation

## Overview

This update implements a comprehensive token refresh mechanism to solve the 401 Unauthorized errors in the GameFundManager React Native app. The solution includes token validation, automatic refresh, and better error handling throughout the authentication flow.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Token Service (`token.service.ts`)

- Added token expiration tracking and validation
- Implemented token refresh mechanism
- Added helpers for token state management

### 2. Enhanced API Service (`api.service.ts`)

- Added token validation before API calls
- Implemented automatic request retry after token refresh
- Added special error handling for authentication failures
- Improved error messages and logging

### 3. Updated Auth Service (`auth.service.ts`)

- Modified login to save token expiry information
- Enhanced logout to clear token data properly
- Added token validation to getCurrentUser
- Made logout method async to support token cleanup

### 4. Improved AuthContext (`AuthContext.tsx`)

- Added token validation during app startup
- Enhanced user authentication state management
- Added token validation before updating user info
- Added automatic logout when tokens are invalid

### 5. Fixed UserDetailsScreen (`UserDetailsScreen.tsx`)

- Enhanced token validation with the new token service
- Improved retry mechanism for handling auth failures
- Added better error messaging for authentication issues

## How It Works

1. When a user logs in, the token and its expiry time are stored
2. Before each API call, the token is validated and refreshed if needed
3. If a 401 error occurs, the system attempts to refresh the token and retry
4. If refresh fails, the user is logged out and error messages guide them

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Log in to the app
2. Wait until token would normally expire (token service simulates expiry)
3. Attempt operations that require authentication
4. Observe how the app automatically refreshes the token and continues

## Backend Requirements

The backend should implement a token refresh endpoint at `/auth/refresh-token` that:
- Accepts the current token
- Returns a new token and expiry date if the current one is valid
- Returns an error if the token cannot be refreshed

## Future Enhancements

1. Add visual feedback during token refresh operations
2. Implement background token refresh to prevent interruptions
3. Add more sophisticated token storage with encryption
