# GameFundApp Implementation Progress

## Recently Fixed Issues

### 1. Infinite API Call Loop in Group Listing
- Modified the `useApi` hook to use an empty dependency array to prevent re-fetching
- Enhanced the GroupsScreen component to avoid unnecessary state updates by:
  - Adding proper ID comparison before updating the filtered groups state
  - Only updating the state when the group IDs have actually changed

### 2. User Profile Updates
- Added profile editing capabilities to the ProfileScreen:
  - Implemented edit mode toggle
  - Added form fields for user name
  - Added save and cancel buttons
  - Connected to the backend API for updating user information

- Enhanced AuthContext with user update functionality:
  - Added `updateUserInfo` method to the context
  - Implemented proper state management for user updates
  - Ensured user data is saved to AsyncStorage

- Fixed user service to handle model conversions properly:
  - Added mapping between app's User model and API's User model
  - Implemented proper error handling for API requests

## Previously Completed

1. Created model interfaces that match backend DTOs
   - User model with auth-related interfaces
   - Group model with member management interfaces
   - Contribution model
   - Expense model with status enum
   - Poll model with poll options and voting interfaces

2. Implemented service classes with methods that call backend API endpoints
   - AuthService with login/register functionality
   - UserService for user management
   - GroupService for group operations and member management
   - ContributionService for financial contributions
   - ExpenseService for expense tracking
   - PollService for polls and voting

3. Updated API infrastructure
   - API service for making HTTP requests
   - Configuration for development vs production environments
   - Type-safe response handling

4. Created utility hooks for API integration
   - useApi hook for managing API calls, loading states, and errors

5. Updated screens to use the services
   - GroupsScreen now uses groupService instead of mock data
   - CreateGroupScreen uses the service for creating groups

## Next Steps

1. Complete integration with remaining screens:
   - GroupDetailsScreen
   - AddExpenseScreen
   - User profile screens
   
âœ… Implemented:
   - GroupsScreen integration
   - AddContributionScreen integration

2. Error handling and feedback
   - Implement consistent error handling throughout the app
   - Add user-friendly error messages

3. Authentication flow
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Session management

4. Offline support
   - Caching strategies for offline data access
   - Queue operations when offline

5. Testing
   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for API calls

## Implementation Notes

The implementation follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns:
- Models represent the data structures
- Services handle business logic and API calls
- Screens handle UI presentation and user interaction
- Hooks provide reusable logic for components

When integrating services with screens:
1. Import the required service
2. Use the useApi hook to manage state and API calls
3. Handle loading, error, and success states appropriately
4. Implement proper UI feedback
