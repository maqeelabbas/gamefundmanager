# Group Member Management Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the group member management feature in the GameFund Manager application. This feature allows group administrators to search for and add existing users to their groups, assign admin roles, set contribution start dates, and manage member contributions.

## Completed Work

### Backend
- Enhanced GroupMember entity with contribution management properties
- Added DTOs for member operations (AddGroupMemberDto, PauseMemberContributionDto, UserSearchResponseDto)
- Created SearchUsersAsync method in UserRepository and UserService
- Added member management endpoints to GroupsController:
  - GET `/groups/{groupId}/members` - List group members
  - POST `/groups/{groupId}/members` - Add member to group
  - DELETE `/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}` - Remove member from group
  - PATCH `/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}/role` - Update member role
  - POST `/groups/{groupId}/members/pause-contribution` - Pause member contribution
  - POST `/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}/resume-contribution` - Resume member contribution

### Frontend
- Created userService.searchUsers function to call the user search API
- Enhanced groupService with member management functions
- Added AddGroupMemberScreen component with user search functionality
- Updated MembersTab component to support member management operations
- Added debounced search for better UX when searching for users
- Implemented member filtering and sorting functionality
- Enhanced PauseContributionModal with better date handling and presets
- Improved error handling and validation across all components

## Features
1. **User Search**: Administrators can search for users by name or email to add to their groups
   - Debounced search to prevent excessive API calls
   - Validation to ensure search term is at least 3 characters
   - Filters out users who are already in the group

2. **Member Role Management**: Assign or revoke admin privileges for group members
   - Single-click role change through member options
   - Visual indicators for admin status in member list

3. **Contribution Management**: 
   - Set contribution start dates for new members
   - Pause and resume member contributions with configurable date ranges
   - Preset duration options (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, custom)
   - Automatic date validation to prevent invalid date combinations

4. **Member Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Filter by status (all, active, paused)
   - Filter by role (admin, regular member)
   - Sort by name, role, status, or joined date
   - Text search within member list

5. **Member Statistics**: Visual summary of member statistics including:
   - Total member count
   - Number of admins
   - Number of active contributors
   - Number of paused contributors

## Usage
1. Navigate to a group detail screen
2. Select the "Members" tab
3. Click "Add Member" to search for and add existing users
4. Use the filtering and sorting options to find specific members
5. Use the member options menu to manage existing members
6. View member statistics at the bottom of the screen

## Technical Notes
- User search includes debounce (500ms) to prevent excessive API calls
- Member contribution pausing includes configurable start and end dates with validation
- AddGroupMemberScreen prevents adding users who are already in the group
- Member list includes optimized filtering and sorting for large groups
- The PauseContributionModal includes preset duration options and date validation
- Extensive error handling and user feedback throughout the flow

## Future Enhancements
- Add functionality to invite new users via email
- Implement contribution amount management per member
- Add batch member management options
- Add notification system for member status changes
- Implement member activity tracking and reporting
