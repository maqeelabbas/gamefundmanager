# Group Member Management Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the group member management functionality in the GameFund Manager application.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Model Enhancements
- Added new properties to the `GroupMember` entity:
  - `JoinedDate`: Records when a member joined the group
  - `ContributionStartDate`: When the member's contributions start
  - `IsContributionPaused`: Flag indicating if contributions are temporarily paused
  - `ContributionPauseStartDate`: When the pause period begins
  - `ContributionPauseEndDate`: When the pause period ends

### 2. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Created `AddGroupMemberDto`: For adding members to groups
- Created `PauseMemberContributionDto`: For managing contribution pauses
- Created `UserSearchResponseDto`: For user search results

### 3. API Endpoints
Added the following endpoints to `GroupsController`:
- **GET** `/api/groups/{groupId}/members`: Get all members in a group
- **POST** `/api/groups/{groupId}/members`: Add a new member to a group
- **DELETE** `/api/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}`: Remove a member from a group
- **PATCH** `/api/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}/role`: Update a member's admin status
- **POST** `/api/groups/{groupId}/members/pause-contribution`: Pause a member's contribution
- **POST** `/api/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}/resume-contribution`: Resume a paused contribution

Added to `UsersController`:
- **GET** `/api/users/search`: Search for users by name or email

### 4. Service Implementations
- Enhanced `IGroupService` and `GroupService` with methods for member management
- Enhanced `IUserService` and `UserService` with methods for searching users

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Models and Types
- Updated `GroupMember` interface to include new properties
- Added `AddGroupMemberRequest` interface
- Added `PauseMemberContributionRequest` interface
- Added `UserSearchResult` interface

### 2. Services
- Added `searchUsers` method to `userService`
- Added the following methods to `groupService`:
  - `updateMemberRole`
  - `pauseMemberContribution`
  - `resumeMemberContribution`

### 3. Screens and Components
- Created `AddGroupMemberScreen`: Allows searching for users and adding them to a group
- Enhanced `MembersTab`: Added functionality for adding, removing, and managing members
- Created `PauseContributionModal`: Custom date picker for managing contribution pauses

### 4. Navigation
- Added `AddGroupMember` screen to the navigation stack
- Updated TypeScript types to include the new route

## Features Implemented

1. **User Search**:
   - Search users by name or email with debounce for better performance
   - Display search results with name and email

2. **Adding Members**:
   - Add existing users to a group
   - Set the member's role (admin or regular)
   - Set contribution start date

3. **Managing Member Roles**:
   - Promote/demote between admin and regular member roles
   - Only admins can change member roles

4. **Contribution Management**:
   - Pause member contributions with specified start and end dates
   - Resume paused contributions
   - View contribution status in the member list

5. **Member Removal**:
   - Remove members from a group
   - Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental removals

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**:
   - All member management endpoints require authentication
   - Only group admins can add/remove members or modify roles and contributions
   - API calls include validation of the requester's admin status

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Client and server-side validation for all inputs
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Invitation System**:
   - Allow inviting new users by email who aren't yet in the system
   - Add invitation acceptance/rejection workflow

2. **Advanced Member Filters**:
   - Filter members by role, contribution status, or join date

3. **Member Contribution Reporting**:
   - Display detailed contribution history for each member
   - Show statistics on contribution compliance

4. **Notification System**:
   - Notify users when they're added to a group
   - Send reminders when a contribution pause is ending
